ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @neff-jordan!

ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge in the field of computer science. My current focus is on pursuing opportunities in back-end development ideally for the space or defense industry. Other interests include robotics and machine learning but my exposure to each has been limited. 

ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in Java and I have experience with R, Python, and C. Currently focused on strengthening my backend devlopment skills by working with more databases and API's in my personal projects. I am also starting to learn C++ and Rust for my robotics interest. 

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at neff.jordan1936@gmail.com. I'm always open to connecting and exploring new opportunities in the world of CS!
