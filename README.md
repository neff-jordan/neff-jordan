Hi, I’m Jordan

I am a computer science major with a minor in statistics at West Chester University, expected to graduate in December 2025. I have a passion for writing code that solves meaningful problems.

I’m particularly interested in three sectors within tech: back-end development, data science/ML, and cybersecurity. My GitHub repos primarily reflect my focus on back-end development, which aligns with the early stages of my degree program. However, as I progress through my studies, I’m exploring the possibility of pivoting to one of the other two areas as I gain more exposure. All that to say I am looking for a company that gives me the option to change course if that is the path I decide to go down. 

Thanks for reading.
